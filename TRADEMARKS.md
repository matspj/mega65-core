The MEGA65 BIOS/Hypervisor was called KICKSTART.
We believe that this does not infringe on any
existing trademarks. Our reasoning being as follows:

KICKSTART lapsed as a trademark on computers in
Australia on 17 July 1990 (Trademark 478242).

A search for KICKSTART in the US Trademark register
revealed no registered trademark for KICKSTART with
relation to Commodore(tm) or Amiga(tm) computers.

However, in an abundance of caution, and without
conceding that any trademark rights might still
exist, we are instead calling it HYPPO or HYPPOBOOT, 
depending on the context.
