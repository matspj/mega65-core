## This is the 'how to edit documentation' documentation file.

# Introduction
We have decided to try and use the github '*.md' pages to document the design.
The intention is to have the documentation in one place, close to the source, and always reflect the current build status.

# What to document
Everything.
At this stage we want to draw a line in the sand and document everything we know about the project. This includes:

1. how-to guides
1. how software is developed
1. how hardware is connected
1. how to use/develop
1. etc

# How to document

1. git uses the markdown language, some online pages describing the format can be found here:
https://help.github.com/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
1. a suggested workflow for modifying/adding pages is:
 1. clone the repo,
 1. edit the .md file,
 1. view the rendered page in your browser using 'grip' (see below),
 1. re-edit the .md file,
 1. re-view the rendered page (and loop 4-5 until it looks nice),
 1. commit the file locally and push to the repo.

1. grip can be found here:
https://github.com/joeyespo/grip
 1. install the python-installer ```sudo apt-get install python-pip```
 1. clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/joeyespo/grip```
 1. cd into the base dir ```cd grip```
 1. install grip ```sudo python setup.py install```



1. grip can now be run from your working directory
 1. navigate to working directory ```cd <mega65>/mega65-core/doc```
 1. start grip rendering pages ```grip index.md &```
 1. in browser, goto [http://localhost:6419/](http://localhost:6419/) where grip is rendering the index.md file
 1. to stop grip ```killall grip```
