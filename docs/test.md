## Introduction

This document describes a number of tests that can be performed to verify that the design works as it should.

Within each test procedure, the tests are denoted as bullet-points, followed by some text describing what to do.
Results are denoted as "-> something", where something is the expected result.

A description of the hardware is shown below:
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ben-401/mega65pics/master/board.jpg)
The above image shows:
* Nexys4DDR development board,
* VGA port connected to a vga monitor capable of 800x600 @ 50Hz and 60Hz
* USB port connected to a simple USB keyboard,
* PROG/UART port connected to host-PC, for two reasons:
 * to provide power to the Nexys board, and
 * to allow serial comms between Nexys and host-PC.
The host-PC should have the m65dbg running or a suitable serial-port program. I use picocom.
* SDMICRO port has a SDcard inserted, SDcard should contain the following files at a minimum:
 * ``bit03141732_dev..._1541f08~.bit (or similar)``
``BOOTLOGO.M65 (optional)``
``CHARROM.M65``
``MEGA65.D81``
``MEGA65.ROM``
* FPGA-Switches (SW-x) all in their OFF position, which is DOWN, if using a Nexys4 or Nexys4DDR development board.

## Test Procedure

All tests, unless otherwise noted, begin with the hardware as described above in the "Introduction" section above.

For the individual tests, please see below.
* [Power and BOOT-up](./test-powerandbootup.md) - applies power and describes what should happen when the buttons/switches are manipulated.
* [c65 mode](./test-c65mode.md) - navigates around the c65 environment exploring its features.


The End.
