## c65 mode

Simple set of tests to verify that C65 mode is working correctly.

* Power up the board:
ensure that the host-PC is providing power through the USB cable, and that the POWER switch is ON.
-> verify that the VGA screen shows the same as below:
![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ben-401/mega65pics/master/c65mode.jpg)

* directory listing (F3):
press F3 on the USB keyboard,
-> a directory listing of the currently mounted "D81" image-file should be displayed.
-> during disk access, a red square should be displayed in the upper-LHS od the display.

* screen toggle (F1):
press F3 on the USB keyboard,
-> the screen should toggle between 40 and 80 char mode,
-> each press of F1 should clear the display.

* other F-keys:
press F7 on the USB keyboard,
-> the cursor should implement the "down" keystroke.
(unsure if this is the expected behaviour, but this does what it does).

* double-tap RESTORE:
NOTE that on the USB-KB, the CBM/RESTORE key is mapped to the PG-UP key.
double-tap the restore/PGUP key
-> the border color should increase (or decrease) in value,

* type "LIST":
type "LIST" and press "ENTER"
-> two blank lines should be displayed, followed by the "READY." prompt.
IE: nothing should be in the BASIC memory.

* type "DIR":
type "DIR" and press "ENTER"
-> a directory listing of the currently mounted "D81" image-file should be displayed.
NOTE that the list displayed should be identical to when pressing "F3"

* load and display the directory listing:
type ```load"$",8``` followed by "ENTER"
-> the following should be displayed:
```
SEARCHING FOR $
LOADING
READY.
```
-> during disk access, the red square should be displayed in the upper-LHS of the screen,
type "LIST" and press "ENTER"
-> a directory listing of the currently mounted "D81" image-file should be displayed.
NOTE that the list displayed should be identical to when pressing "F3"

* slowing down the DIR-listing:
NOTE that on the USB-KB, the CBM/COMMODORE key is mapped to the Left-CTRL key.
change the display to 40-columns by pressing F1,
hold CBM/COMMODORE KEY and press F3 numerous times,
-> a directory listing of the currently mounted "D81" image-file should be displayed.
-> the listing should fill the screen and continue to scroll-up. This scrolling-up should be slowed-down due to the holding of the CBM/COMMODORE key.

* MONITOR mode:
type "MONITOR" and press "ENTER"
-> the following should be displayed (or similar):
```
MONITOR
    PC   SR AC XR YR ZR SP
; 000000 00 00 00 00 00 F8
```
type "D 2000" and press "ENTER"
-> the following should be displayed (or similar):
```
. 002000  0
. 002001  1F 20 00   BBR1 $20,$2004
.    .
.    .
.    .
. 002014  32 2E      AND  ($2E),Z
```
type "X" and press "ENTER"
-> the "READY." prompt should be displayed indicating that you have exited out of the MONITOR-mode.

* go into c64 mode
type "GO64" and press "ENTER"
-> you will be presented with the following:
```ARE YOU SURE?```
TYPE ``` Y ``` and press "ENTER".
-> you will be dropped into the c64 mode.

* boot into C64 mode
in either c64 mode or c65 mode, press and hold the CBM/COMMODORE key (on USB-KB this is the Left-CTRL),
-> nothing should happen.
while holding Left-CTRL, press and release the CPU_RESET button
-> the machine will reset,
-> after the boot-screen, if the Left-CTRL is depressed, you will drop directly into the c64 mode. This mode is shown below.

The End.
